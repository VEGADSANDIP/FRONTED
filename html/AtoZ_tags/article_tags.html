        Title: Seeking Advice on Upgrading My PC

        Hello everyone,

        I have been considering upgrading my PC to better handle graphic-intensive tasks like gaming and video editing. I currently have a system with the following specs:

        <ul>
            <li>Processor: Intel Core i5-8400</li>
            <li>RAM: 8GB DDR4</li>
            <li>Graphics Card: NVIDIA GTX 1050 Ti</li>
            <li>Storage: 256GB SSD</li>
        </ul>
        I am on a budget and would love to hear your suggestions on which components would give me the best performance boost for my money. I’m particularly interested in whether it’s worth upgrading to an SSD with more capacity or if I should focus on the graphics card instead.

        Thanks in advance for your help!

        Best, PCEnthusiast123
